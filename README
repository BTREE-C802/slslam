This code implements a Stereo Line-based SLAM (SLSLAM) presented in
"Building a 3D Line-based Map Using a Stereo SLAM," in a revision
process of IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

Dependencies: Ceres-solver 1.7.0, OpenCV 2.4.10, Google Flags 2.1.0, Google
Logging 0.0.0, OpenGL, GLFW

All dependencies should be installed in your system beforehand.
